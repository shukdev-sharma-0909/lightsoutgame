        <h2>📜 Addendum: Process and Creative Choices</h2>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
        <p>The goal was to create a <strong>Lights Out game</strong> using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I started by setting up the HTML structure, including the grid container and control buttons to change grid size and reset the game. I then styled the grid cells with a transparent, card-like effect using <code>rgba</code> colors and <code>box-shadow</code> for a subtle depth.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Creative Choices:</strong></p>
        <p>I chose a <strong>transparent card effect</strong> for the grid cells to create a sleek, modern interface. The subtle <code>box-shadow</code> added a 3-dimensional appearance, enhancing the visual experience. Providing buttons to switch grid sizes (3x3, 4x4, and 5x5) made the game <strong>scalable and adaptable</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Challenges and Insights:</strong></p>
        <p>One challenge was accurately toggling neighboring cells, which I solved by calculating row and column indices with arithmetic operations. Maintaining a consistent visual appearance across different grid sizes required dynamic adjustments to <strong>CSS grid properties</strong>.</p>

        <p>Through this project, I gained insights into <strong>efficient DOM manipulation with jQuery</strong>, <strong>CSS Grid layouts</strong>, and the importance of <strong>scalable design</strong>. I also learned that attention to small visual details, like shadows and rounded corners, significantly enhances the <strong>user experience</strong> and interface aesthetics.</p>
